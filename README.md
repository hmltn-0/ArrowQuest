# The Arrows Game

## Description
The Arrows Game is an exploratory/pilot project aimed at teaching people category theory in an extremely simple and interactive way. This project is designed to be universally accessible, catering to anyone from elementary school students to adults without significant mathematical inclination, as well as providing valid practice for people who already study math or category theory.

This project also explores the potential of category theory to become a recreational game. Additionally, it considers the possibility of enabling users to build diagrams that can be compiled or transpiled into actual executable code, effectively creating an arrow-based programming language.
